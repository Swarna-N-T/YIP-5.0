### About the project ðŸ¤”

This is a QR code-based system that provides immediate access to critical details of accident victims, including personal information and medical records, enabling efficient and timely rescue operations while ensuring appropriate medical care based on the victim's medical history.

The QR code will contain essential personal information about the victim, including their name, age, blood type, and emergency contact details. Additionally, it will incorporate the victim's previous medical records, such as known allergies, pre-existing conditions, and current medications. This comprehensive data can provide crucial insights for medical professionals, ensuring appropriate and timely treatment.

Accidents often occur unexpectedly, leaving victims in urgent need of medical attention. In such situations, providing quick access to crucial information about the victim can significantly impact the effectiveness of rescue operations and subsequent medical treatment. The existing methods of gathering victim details, such as relying on physical identification cards or searching for information through traditional databases, can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when every second counts.
